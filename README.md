The GUI is structured around three core panel modules:

(1) Data Input Module
Configures 21 feature parameter input fields covering key variables such as raw material quantities, specimen dimensions, and curing conditions. The module includes dynamic range validation to ensure all entries comply with predefined constraints.

(2) Multi‑Objective Output Module
Displays real‑time computational results across five optimization dimensions, including performance metrics and cross‑scale environmental indicators.

(3) Control Unit Module
Integrates functional buttons (“Predict”, “Clear”, “Save”, “Exit”). Clicking “Predict” triggers the immediate display of prediction outcomes corresponding to the entered parameters.
