This warehouse contains original auxiliary materials and GUI running code. If you have any questions about the original text, please contact weizhang01@tongji.edu.cn. If you find it helpful, please quote the original article. The GUI architecture consists of three core panel modules: 
(1) The data input module configures 21 feature parameter input regions covering critical variables including raw materials quantities, specimen specifications, and curing conditions, incorporating dynamic range validation to ensure compliance with predefined constraints. (2) The multi-objective output module displays real-time computational results across five optimisation dimensions, encompassing performance and cross-scale environmental indicators. 
(3) The control unit module integrates functional buttons ('Predict', 'Clear', 'Save', 'Exit'), where activating the 'Predict' command triggers immediate display of parameter-matched prediction outcomes.
